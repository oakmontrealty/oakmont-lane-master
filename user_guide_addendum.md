### Advanced Features & Best Practices

**AI Summary Customization**
- After each call, the system generates a summary. You can edit the summary before saving it to the CRM.
- Use the summary fields to highlight key insights or action items for the client record.

**Multi‑Agent Campaigns**
- When running outbound campaigns, multiple agents can dial from the same contact list.
- Use the dashboard to monitor call progress and reassign leads if an agent becomes unavailable.

**CRM Integration Best Practices**
- Ensure call logs and summaries are linked to the correct contact or opportunity.
- Use dispositions to trigger automated follow‑up tasks or email sequences through the CRM.

### Dispositions & Follow‑Ups (Detailed)

After hanging up, select a call disposition that reflects the outcome (e.g., Answered, Voicemail, No Answer, Not Interested). Add notes summarizing the conversation and set follow‑up dates.

1. Click **Add Disposition** when the call ends.
2. Choose an outcome from the drop‑down and enter notes.
3. Set a follow‑up date/time if applicable and click **Save**.
4. The CRM will automatically create a task or reminder based on the disposition.

### Tips for Efficiency

- Use keyboard shortcuts (e.g., **Tab** to move between fields, **Enter** to save) to speed up call logging.
- Pre‑write common phrases or templates for summaries and notes; copy/paste as needed.
- Regularly review your call summaries to identify patterns and improve your script.

### Support & Troubleshooting

- If you cannot log in, ensure your credentials are correct and the VoIP service is online.
- For network issues, switch to a wired connection or relocate to improve Wi‑Fi signal.
- If audio is not working, check your microphone settings and grant permission when prompted.
